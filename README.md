# Twitter Sentiment Analysis using NLP and Machine Learning

This repository contains a Python script for performing sentiment analysis on Twitter data using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning algorithms. The script preprocesses the text data, extracts features using CountVectorizer, and trains a machine learning model to classify the sentiment of tweets.

## Dataset
